# Next Word Prediction using LSTM & GRU

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **next-word prediction** using **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** architectures — **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** and **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)** — trained on the text of **William Shakespeare’s *Hamlet***.

The objective is to learn word-level language patterns and predict the most probable next word given a sequence of text. The project also enables a comparison of the modeling capability of LSTM and GRU architectures.

An interactive **Streamlit web application** is provided to explore predictions in real time.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Build word-level language models using **LSTM and GRU**
- Train models on a literary corpus (*Hamlet*)
- Predict the next word given an input sequence
- Compare performance and behavior of LSTM vs GRU
- Deploy the trained models using **Streamlit**
